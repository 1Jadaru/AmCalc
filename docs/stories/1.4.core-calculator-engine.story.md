### Calculator Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/detailed-technical-specifications.md#Key Frontend Patterns]

**Component Design Pattern:**
```typescript
// Calculator Component Interface
interface CalculatorProps {
  initialValues?: CalculatorInputs;
  onCalculate: (results: AmortizationResults) => void;
  onSave?: (scenario: Scenario) => void;
}

const Calculator: React.FC<CalculatorProps> = ({
  initialValues,
  onCalculate,
  onSave
}) => {
  const [inputs, setInputs] = useState<CalculatorInputs>(initialValues || {});
  const [results, setResults] = useState<AmortizationResults | null>(null);
  
  // Component logic here
};
```

**Service Layer Pattern:**
```typescript
// Calculator Service Example
class CalculatorService {
  async calculateAmortization(inputs: AmortizationInputs): Promise<AmortizationResults> {
    // Validate inputs
    const validatedInputs = this.validateInputs(inputs);
    
    // Perform calculations
    const results = this.performCalculations(validatedInputs);
    
    // Format results
    return this.formatResults(results);
  }
  
  private validateInputs(inputs: AmortizationInputs): ValidatedInputs {
    // Input validation logic
  }
  
  private performCalculations(inputs: ValidatedInputs): RawResults {
    // Calculation logic
  }
  
  private formatResults(results: RawResults): AmortizationResults {
    // Results formatting
  }
}
```

### Data Models and Types
[Source: docs/architecture/detailed-technical-specifications.md#Database Schema Design]

**Calculator Input Types:**
```typescript
interface AmortizationInputs {
  principal: number;        // Loan amount (e.g., 200000)
  interestRate: number;     // Annual interest rate (e.g., 3.5)
  termYears: number;        // Loan term in years (e.g., 30)
  paymentFrequency?: string; // Default: 'monthly'
  startDate?: Date;         // Optional loan start date
}

interface AmortizationResults {
  paymentAmount: number;    // Monthly payment amount
  totalInterest: number;    // Total interest paid
  totalPayments: number;    // Total payments made
  schedule: PaymentRow[];   // Complete amortization table
  summary: {
    principal: number;
    interestRate: number;
    termYears: number;
    numberOfPayments: number;
  };
}

interface PaymentRow {
  paymentNumber: number;
  paymentAmount: number;
  principalPayment: number;
  interestPayment: number;
  remainingBalance: number;
}
```

### API Design Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/detailed-technical-specifications.md#API Design Patterns]

**RESTful Endpoint Structure:**
```typescript
// Calculator API Endpoint
router.post('/api/calculator/amortization', authMiddleware, validateCalculatorInput, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const results = await calculatorService.calculateAmortization(req.body);
    res.json({ success: true, data: results });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### Responsive Design Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/detailed-technical-specifications.md#Responsive Design Strategy]

**Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS:**
```css
/* Calculator container responsive design */
.calculator-container {
  @apply w-full max-w-md mx-auto p-4; /* Mobile */
  
  @apply sm:max-w-lg sm:p-6; /* Small screens */
  
  @apply md:max-w-2xl md:p-8; /* Medium screens */
  
  @apply lg:max-w-4xl lg:p-10; /* Large screens */
  
  @apply xl:max-w-6xl xl:p-12; /* Extra large screens */
}
```

### File Locations
- **API Routes**: `src/app/api/calculator/amortization/route.ts` (Next.js 13+ App Router)
- **Calculator Service**: `src/services/calculator.service.ts`
- **Calculator Types**: `src/types/calculator.types.ts`
- **Calculator Components**: `src/components/features/calculator/` directory
  - `CalculatorForm.tsx` - Main calculator form
  - `ResultsDisplay.tsx` - Results display component
  - `AmortizationTable.tsx` - Amortization table component
- **Calculator Page**: `src/app/calculator/page.tsx`
- **Validation Schemas**: `src/utils/validation.ts` (extend existing file)
- **Test Files**: `src/test/calculator/` directory

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/implementation-guidelines.md#Testing Strategy]

**Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library + Supertest for integration tests
**Test File Location**: `src/test/calculator/` directory
**Test Coverage**: 90%+ for calculator business logic

**Unit Test Example Pattern:**
```typescript
describe('CalculatorService', () => {
  it('should calculate monthly payment correctly', () => {
    const inputs = {
      principal: 200000,
      interestRate: 3.5,
      termYears: 30
    };
    
    const result = calculatorService.calculateMonthlyPayment(inputs);
    expect(result).toBeCloseTo(898.09, 2);
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Example Pattern:**
```typescript
describe('Calculator API', () => {
  it('should calculate amortization successfully', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/calculator/amortization')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userToken}`)
      .send({
        principal: 200000,
        interestRate: 3.5,
        termYears: 30
      });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body.data.paymentAmount).toBeCloseTo(898.09, 2);
  });
});
```

### Technical Constraints
- Must use standard amortization formula: P = L[c(1 + c)^n]/[(1 + c)^n - 1]
- All calculations must be performed with decimal precision (no floating point errors)
- Input validation must prevent negative values and invalid ranges
- Performance optimization required for large loan terms (30+ years)
- Mobile-first responsive design required
- All calculator components must be accessible (WCAG AA compliance)
- Real-time validation without blocking user input

### Security Considerations
- Input validation to prevent calculation attacks
- Rate limiting for calculator API endpoints
- Authentication required for calculator access
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Validate calculation results before returning to client

### Performance Considerations
- Implement calculation memoization for repeated inputs
- Optimize amortization table generation for large terms
- Use efficient number handling to avoid floating point errors
- Implement lazy loading for large amortization tables
- Cache calculation results for common loan scenarios

### Calculation Formulas
**Monthly Payment Formula:**
```
P = L[c(1 + c)^n]/[(1 + c)^n - 1]
Where:
P = Monthly Payment
L = Loan Amount (Principal)
c = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
n = Total Number of Payments (Years * 12)
```

**Amortization Schedule Generation:**
For each payment period:
1. Interest Payment = Remaining Balance × Monthly Interest Rate
2. Principal Payment = Monthly Payment - Interest Payment
3. Remaining Balance = Previous Balance - Principal Payment
