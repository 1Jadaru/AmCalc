# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Goal 1**: Create a professional, mobile-first amortization calculator that serves individuals, small business owners, and real estate investors
- **Goal 2**: Provide intuitive loan modeling with project-based scenario organization and selective saving capabilities
- **Goal 3**: Achieve 1,000+ unique monthly users with ad revenue covering operational costs
- **Goal 4**: Establish a foundation for premium features and subscription revenue in v2
- **Goal 5**: Deliver a superior mobile experience compared to existing calculator tools

## Background Context

AmCalc addresses a significant gap in the financial calculator market. While numerous amortization calculators exist, most lack modern mobile-first design, scenario management capabilities, and professional presentation features. The target market includes individuals modeling loans for major purchases, small business owners analyzing financing options, and real estate investors comparing investment scenarios.

The current landscape is fragmented between simple web calculators, complex Excel templates, and bank-specific tools that lack portability. AmCalc will differentiate through its mobile-responsive design, project organization system, and focus on user experience that enables confident financial decision-making.
