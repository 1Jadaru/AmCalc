## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Next.js 15.4.1 project is set up with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and ESLint. The project structure is established with components, hooks, utils, types, and styles folders. Environment variables are configured with .env.local file. Hot reloading is working with fast compilation times.

### Technology Stack Requirements

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens (for future stories)

### Database Schema Design
[Source: docs/architecture/detailed-technical-specifications.md#Database Schema Design]

**Core Tables Required:**

**Users Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  last_login TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Projects Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  is_archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Scenarios Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE scenarios (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  principal DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  interest_rate DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL,
  term_years INTEGER NOT NULL,
  payment_frequency VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'monthly',
  start_date DATE,
  payment_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
  total_interest DECIMAL(15,2),
  total_payments DECIMAL(15,2),
  amortization_schedule JSONB,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**User Sessions Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Performance Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_user_id ON projects(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_archived ON projects(is_archived);
CREATE INDEX idx_scenarios_project_id ON scenarios(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_scenarios_created_at ON scenarios(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_sessions_user_id ON user_sessions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_sessions_expires_at ON user_sessions(expires_at);
```

### Prisma Configuration Requirements
**Prisma Schema Structure:**
- Use UUID primary keys with gen_random_uuid() default
- Implement proper foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletes
- Use JSONB for complex data like amortization_schedule and metadata
- Include created_at and updated_at timestamps on all tables
- Configure proper field types and constraints

**Connection Pooling Configuration:**
- Set appropriate pool size for development environment
- Configure connection timeout settings
- Implement proper error handling for connection failures

### File Locations
- **Prisma Schema**: `prisma/schema.prisma` (root level)
- **Migrations**: `prisma/migrations/` directory
- **Seed Scripts**: `prisma/seed.ts` or `scripts/seed.ts`
- **Database Utils**: `src/utils/database.ts` for connection helpers
- **Environment Variables**: `.env.local` for local development
- **Type Definitions**: `src/types/database.ts` for Prisma-generated types

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/amcalc_dev"
DATABASE_URL_TEST="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/amcalc_test"

# Connection Pool Settings
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=10
DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/implementation-guidelines.md#Testing Strategy]

**Testing Framework**: Jest + Supertest for integration tests
**Test File Location**: `__tests__/` folders alongside components or `tests/` directory
**Database Testing**: Use separate test database with Prisma test environment

**Integration Test Example Pattern:**
```typescript
describe('Database Connection', () => {
  it('should connect to database successfully', async () => {
    const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1 as test`;
    expect(result).toEqual([{ test: 1 }]);
  });
});
```

### Technical Constraints
- Must use PostgreSQL 15+ for UUID support and JSONB data types
- Prisma ORM is mandatory for type-safe database operations
- All database operations must be properly typed with TypeScript
- Connection pooling is required for performance optimization
- Environment variables must be properly secured and not committed to git
- Database migrations must be version controlled and reversible

### Security Considerations
- Database credentials must never be committed to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper connection string validation
- Set up database user with minimal required permissions
- Configure proper firewall rules for database access
